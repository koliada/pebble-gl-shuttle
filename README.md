GlobalLogic KBP Shuttle Bus Schedule
=================

GlobalLogic Ukraine Kiev office shuttle bus schedule
----------------------------------------------------

This Pebble app was made just to justify the purchase 
and to prove myself that I am able to deal with an old school C :)

GL-Shuttle v.0.1 can:
- Show you the shuttle bus schedule for Kiev office, devided onto the two directions (from and to BC 'Protasov'); 
every direction devided onto the two destinations - Subway 'Palats Ukraina' and 'Druzhby Narodiv'
- Search for nearest bus for every direction and every destination;
to search, press central button while watching the schedule

This app could be extended to handle any type of schedules set on the smartphone.

Based on the [simple-menu-layer](https://github.com/pebble/pebble-sdk-examples/tree/master/watchapps/feature_simple_menu_layer) Pebble SDK example.
